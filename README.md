# World Clock Application

This Python application uses the tkinter library to create a GUI with four world clocks. Each clock displays the ticking of the hour, minute, and second hands, and has its own dropdown menu featuring 20 major cities around the world. Additionally, it provides real-time stock information for major stock indexes such as Nasdaq, Dow Jones, and popular FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google).

## Features

I was not able to  reduce the width of the drop downs. Also the circle of the clock seems to have vanished. I am unable to draw it satisfactorily.
